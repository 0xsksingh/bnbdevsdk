## What is BNB Dev SDK?

BNB Dev SDK is a comprehensive web3 development stack created by [Kamal Singh](https://twitter.com/0xkamal7) and powered by [hardhat](https://hardhat.org). It is designed to help developers create full-stack web3 applications on BNB-compatible chains with ease.

### Key Features:

- **TypeScript**: Ensures type-safe development throughout your project.
- **Modular Structure**: Divided into two main parts:
  1. **Contracts**: Utilizes [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/), the [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) framework, and [hardhat](https://hardhat.org). Ready for deployment on all BNB-supported chains including BNB, OpBNB, and BNB-Greenfield.
  2. **Application**: Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), and [hardhat](https://hardhat.org).

This opinionated template focuses on developer experience, aiming to create performant, scalable, and secure web3 applications with elegant user interfaces.

## Why Use BNB Dev SDK?

BNB Dev SDK includes everything you need in a modern web3 development stack:

- **Type-Safe Environment**: Leverage TypeScript for consistency and reliability across your project.
- **Beautiful UI Components**: Utilize [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for pre-built components and customize your styles with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
- **Smooth Onboarding**: Provide seamless onboarding experiences with support for local wallets and account abstraction.
- **Decentralized Services Integration**: Easily connect to decentralized services using the provided infrastructure.

## Getting Started

To start building your web3 application with BNB Dev SDK, run the following command:

```sh
npx bnbdevsdk create my-bnb-app
```

This command sets up a new project with the necessary structure and dependencies to get you up and running quickly.

## Example Structure

```
my-bnb-app/
